1. ### What is a closure in JavaScript and how is it used?

   A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope. Closures are created whenever a function is created, allowing the function to access variables from its outer scope.

   ```javascript
   const outerFunction = (outerVariable) => {
     return (innerVariable) => {
       console.log(`Outer Variable: ${outerVariable}`);
       console.log(`Inner Variable: ${innerVariable}`);
     };
   };

   const newFunction = outerFunction('outside');
   newFunction('inside');
   // Output:
   // Outer Variable: outside
   // Inner Variable: inside
<button class="symbol-button" onclick="copyToClipboard('#closure-code')">üìã Copy Code</button> <button class="symbol-button" onclick="runCode('#closure-code')">‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Code</button>

<button class="symbol-button" onclick="scrollToTop()">‚¨Ü Back to Top</button>
